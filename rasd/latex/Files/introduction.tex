\subsection{Purpose}

The purpose of this document is to provide a description of the SafeStreets system. A detailed explanation of the proposed solution is given, along with the requirements and assumptions made to achieve it.

SafeStreets is a crowd-sourced application that	 intends to provide users with the possibility to notify authorities when traffic violations occur, and in particular	 parking violations. With the amount of traffic we are seeing nowadays, it is hard to maintain order throughout the entire city, so the help of the community is more than welcome.
The application allows users to report violations by sending pictures, along with important information, like the date, time and position.
Examples of violations are vehicles parked in the middle of bike lanes or in places reserved for people with disabilities, double parking, and so on.
The system also allows both end users and authorities to access the information gathered, with different levels of visibility depending on the roles.
With the information provided, it is then possible for the municipality to integrate it with their traffic ticket system and automatically issue the corresponding ticket to a reported offender. This will accelerate the whole process, saving time and money to the state and could eventually result in a decrease in violations.
At the same time, the ticketing system can provide information to SafeStreets, which presents the possibility of building statistics such as the most egregious offenders and analyse the effect of the application by looking at the trend in violations.

\subsection{Scope}

\subsubsection{General purpose}

As already mentioned, the SafeStreets system is designed to provide users with the ability to report traffic violations through an application. In order to achieve this, the user needs to take and upload photos of the scene, which captures the license plate of the vehicle committing the violation and complete a form with information such as the license plate number and the type of violation. This data, along with metadata retrieved from the userâ€™s device (geographical position, date and time) is then sent to the system.

\subsubsection{World and Machine phenomena}
To mark the boundaries of the system, here we denote:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The world phenomena which concern the system (the machine).
        \item The phenomena internal to the machine from a high level point of view.
        \item Shared phenomena that cross from the world to the machine or vice versa.
    \end{itemize}

\begin{table}[H]

    \begin{tabular}{|p{10cm}|c|c|}
    \hline

    Machine cross references its stored report information with the traffic ticket system response and analyses it & N & Machine \\ \hline

\subsubsection{Goals}
\begin{itemize}
\item
[G1] - The user is able to report a traffic violation to authorities.
\item
[G2] - The user is able to visualize reports in a specified area and time.
\item
[G3] - It is possible to query report information in an easily parsable format to allow for data analysis.
\item
[G4] - Only authorities are able to access report pictures and license plates.
\item
[G5] - The system must protect the chain of custody of the reports. 
\item
[G6] - Compromised reports are detected and discarded.
\item
[G7] - Information about issued tickets provided by the municipality system can be cross referenced with the SafeStreets database and analysed.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Definitions, Acronyms, Abbreviations}
\subsubsection{Definitions}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Compromised report: a report that has been modified by an unauthorized agent outside the system boundaries.
    \item Authority: a local agency whose purpose is, as indicated by the current law, to enforce traffic rules. For example: the police.      
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Document structure}
The RASD document is composed of five chapters:\\\\
Chapter 1: The problem is introduced. A description of the purpose of the application is given, followed by the scope, where the world and machine phenomena are explained, along with the system goals. Also, definitions are listed to help the reader understand the concepts used.\\\\
Chapter 2: An overall description of the product. Including a further detailed description of the product, with the help of class and state diagrams, a description of the main functionalities, the different types of actors that interact with the system, and the domain assumptions considered for solving the problem.\\\\
Chapter 3: Specific requirements. This is the main chapter of the document. It includes the external interface requirements, like the user and software interfaces. Scenarios for typical application usage are provided, followed by functional and performance requirements, and the constraints under which the system needs to function. Lastly, the system software attributes are discussed.\\\\
Chapter 4: In this chapter a documented Alloy model is presented for a formal analysis of the problem, along with a discussion of the purpose of this model and what it proves.\\\\
Chapter 5: Shows the effort spent by each member of the group in the development of the document.
