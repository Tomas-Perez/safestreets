\subsection{Purpose}

The purpose of this document is to dive into technical details concerning the SafeStreets system. In the RASD, the system and its functionalities were introduced in an abstract manner. The Design Document focuses more on implementation, explaining the decisions that had to be made and the reasoning behind them.
The topics covered in this document are the following:

\begin{itemize}
    \item 
    An overview of the proposed architecture
    \item 
    The different system components and their interactions
    \item 
    The deployment plan
    \item 
    Utilized design patterns
    \item 
    User interface design and flow
    \item 
    Requirement traceability
    \item 
    The implementation, integration and testing plan
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Scope}

The SafeStreets system is designed to provide users with the ability to report and get information of reported traffic violations through an application. 
Any user with a device capable of running the application can sign up to the system, which enables them to access its functionalities.
In order to submit a report, the user needs to fill a form. In it, they have to enter the license plate number of the vehicle committing the violation, the type of violation and at least one photo of the scene, where the license plate of the vehicle can be easily recognized. This data, along with metadata retrieved from the user's device (geographical position, date and time) is then sent to the system.
The system is responsible for analysing the validity of the report. To achieve this, a license plate recognition algorithm is utilized. When faced with difficulties in the detection, the photo must pass through community review, in which users reach a consensus on the validity of the report photo.
The data collected by the system in relation to reports is to be queried by its users. There are two distinct targets of this functionality: standard users and the municipality. The main difference between the two is that the municipality can access information that should not be freely accessible to everyone because of security and privacy concerns. Through the application, users are capable of visualizing a city map showing where the violations happened. Furthermore, a public API is made available, facilitating data analysis and system integration.
