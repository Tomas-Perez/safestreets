Every design decision made and presented in this document was decided upon with the goals specified in the RASD in mind. From these goals, requirements were extracted; the following list provides a mapping between the goals and requirements, and the system components that help to accomplish them.\\

\begin{itemize}[label={}]
    \item \textbf{[G1] - The user is able to report a traffic violation to authorities.}
